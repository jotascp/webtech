# 1.1.1 Background

As a Cyber Security Management student, my imagination lead me to think on how students could be helped around this subject. 
Nowadays, having programming skills in our "portfolio" is globally recognised as an extremely important advantage to face the labour market. Therefore, my initial approach on this assessment was to create a website owned by a virtual company that offers Programming Courses to students from different levels and backgrounds. 

On a next stage, when planning the website and its features, I have decided that this company and their website would be operating on an "open-based" platform. This system requires the website users to contribute actively on different threads/topics (similar to the mechanisms of a forum). Inittialy, each thread/topic would be focused on displaying a certain real-world problem and then, each user would make their contribution in order to solve the presented challenge - this would be achieved mainly trough individual self-research.
