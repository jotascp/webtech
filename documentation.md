# 1.1.1 Background

As a Cyber Security Management student, my imagination lead me to think on how students could be helped around this subject. Nowadays, having programming skills in our "portfolio" is globally recognised as an extremely important advantage to face the labour market. Therefore, my initial approach on this assessment was to create a website owned by a virtual company that offers Programming Courses to students from different levels and backgrounds.

On a next stage, when planning the website and its features, I have decided that this company and their website would be operating on an "open-based" platform. This system requires the website users to contribute actively on different threads/topics (similar to the mechanisms of a forum). Initially, each thread/topic would be focused on displaying a certain real-world problem and then, each user would make their contribution in order to solve the presented challenge - this would be achieved mainly through individual self-research.

# 1.1.2 Wire Frames

The Wire Frames designed for each webpage are available within the AE2.zip folder uploaded for this assessment.

# 1.1.3 Colour Choices

The entire webpage follows a "white-and-grey rule". In my opinion, this gives a more professional side to our company and at the same time, it does not bring any drawback to the appellative perspective that we intend to present.

# 1.1.4 Accessibility

Being simple and well organised were two aspects I always had in my mind. Nowadays, in order to reach people from different backgrounds, gender and levels of education, it is extremely important to have websites that are simple to understand.

# 1.2.5 GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is also an important topic to discuss. For this, I have created a fictitious copyright ("Joao Costa @ Copyright 2019"). Then, according to the eight individual rights for individuals, I have created a "Contact us" form - with this, people have the possibility to object or suggest a rectification if they desire. Being a public website means that we are also following the "right to be informed" and "right of access" policies.

# 1.2.6 Distance Selling

As this company provides an "open-based" platform and the access to every topic/thread is absolutely free for our users, there is no need to provide some details (address and prices for example). However, the company name is mentioned on the "About us" page.

# 1.2.7 Evaluation

After completing the proposed website, I can conclude that the main goals were successfully achieved - the website has different functionalities and each webpage is appropriately connected.

The main issue was to convert the website following a responsive design to mobile versions. Here, I could not find the breakpoint that triggers each webpage to be adjusted for different mobile devices. Hence, I am now facing an improvement opportunity to tackle this issue in a near future.
